## 🎵 DLforMelodyGen
The project focusses on exploring and comparing deep learning models for monophonic piano melody generation. The aim of this project is to advance the field of music generation by investigating the effectiveness and performance of various deep learning architectures in generating expressive and coherent piano melodies.

## 📝 Project Description
The challenge of creating compelling piano melodies using deep learning techniques. Through rigorous experimentation, we analyze the ability of different models to capture musical patterns, generate diverse melodic sequences, and produce melodies that exhibit musical coherence and stylistic consistency. To conduct our research, we curate a comprehensive dataset of monophonic piano melodies, covering a wide range of musical styles and genres.
